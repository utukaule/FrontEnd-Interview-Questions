Q1. Why Redux?
    ->  When a JavaScript application grows big, it becomes difficult for the user to manage its state.
    ->  Redux solves this problem by managing applications state with a single global object called store.
    ->  Making testing very easy.
    ->  Consistency throughout the application.
